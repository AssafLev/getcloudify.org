# Overview
Version 3.2 introduced security support and so, it is possible to bootstrap the manager with security configuration or without it.

# Login Screen
After bootstrapping the manager with security support, the UI will redirect the users to the Login screen.<br>
The standard `Username` and `Password` are required as well as the option to check `Remember me`. <br>

# Logout
Once logged in, the user name is displayed on the top right of the screen, right next to the `Log out` button. <br>
The user can opt to logout anytime by simply clicking on the `Log out`. <br>
