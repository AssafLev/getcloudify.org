Cloudify's Command-Line Interface is the default method for interacting with Cloudify and managing your applications. It allows to perform actions such as uploading and deleting blueprints, creating deployments, executing workflows and retrieving events.

The interface can be accessed by running the `cfy` command. `cfy -h` will get you started.

A full `cfy` commands reference can be found [here](cli-cfy-reference.html).

Note that some features, such as viewing metric graphs and application topologies are only available via the Web UI.
