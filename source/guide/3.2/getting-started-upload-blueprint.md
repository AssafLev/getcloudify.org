# Overview

For Cloudify to be able to deploy your application's blueprint, you need to upload the blueprint to Cloudify's Management Environment where it, and its resources will be available for deployment. You can upload a blueprint via the CLI or the Web UI.

If you haven't already written a blueprint, you can either [write one now](getting-started-write-bluerpint.html) or you can download an [example blueprint](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-nodecellar-example) for you to upload.

## Uploading via the CLI

To upload a blueprint using Cloudify's CLI execute:

{%highlight bash%}
cfy blueprints upload -b <BLUEPRINT_NAME> -p </path/to/your/blueprint.yamlâ€‹>
{%endhighlight%}


## Uploading via the Web UI

The upload blueprint button can be found in the "Blueprints" section in the UI:

![The blueprint upload button](/guide/images/ui/ui_upload_blueprint_button.png)

Clicking on it will cause the blueprint upload dialog to appear.

The user can either type in the path to the blueprint file, or select it from the filesystem by pressing the `+` button:

The `Blueprint ID` field is required.

The `Blueprint filename` field is optional. If left blank, the default `blueprint.yaml` file will be used. To override, The user should fill out the name of the YAML file to be used.

Once all the required fields are filled, the `Save` button becomes available.

Clicking the `Save` button will cause it to be grayed out until the blueprint file is fully uploaded to Cloudify. After the upload is done, the user will be redirected to the blueprint's page.

# Step 5: Upload the blueprint

  To upload the blueprint run:

  {% inittab %}

  {% tabcontent OpenStack%}
  {%highlight bash%}
  cfy blueprints upload -b nodecellar -p openstack-blueprint.yaml
  {%endhighlight%}
  {% endtabcontent %}

  {% tabcontent SoftLayer%}
  {%highlight bash%}
  cfy blueprints upload -b nodecellar -p softlayer-blueprint.yaml
  {%endhighlight%}
  {% endtabcontent %}

  {% tabcontent AWS EC2%}
  {%highlight bash%}
  cfy blueprints upload -b nodecellar -p aws-ec2-blueprint.yaml
  {%endhighlight%}
  {% endtabcontent %}

  {% tabcontent vCloud %}
  {%highlight bash%}
  cfy blueprints upload -b nodecellar -p vcloud-blueprint.yaml
  {%endhighlight%}
  {% endtabcontent %}

  {% endinittab %}

  The `-b` flag assigns a unique name to this blueprint on the Cloudify manager.
  Before creating a deployment though, let's see what this blueprint looks like.

  Point your browser at the manager's URL again and refresh the screen, you will see the nodecellar blueprint listed there.

  ![Blueprints table](/guide/images3/guide/quickstart/blueprints_table.png)

  Click the blueprint, and you can see its topology.

  A [topology]({{page.terminology_link}}#topology) consists of elements called [nodes]({{page.terminology_link}}#node).

  In our case, we have the following nodes:

  * Two VM's (one for mongo and one for nodejs)
  * A nodejs server
  * A MongoDB database
  * A nodejs application called nodecellar (which is a nice sample nodejs application backed by mongodb).

# What's Next

You should now have a Blueprint ready for you to [deploy](getting-started-create-deployment.html).
