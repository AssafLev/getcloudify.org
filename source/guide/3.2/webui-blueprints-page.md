When clicking on the `Blueprints` tab and choosing a blueprint you will be able to choose one of the following:

# Topology
The [Topology]({{page.terminology_link}}#topology) is an applicationâ€™s graph of nodes and their relationships, which describes the lifecycle events or other operations that each node and relationship exposes for use in workflows.<br>
Each of the blueprint nodes is displayed as a square container, which can contain another nodes. Each of the nodes has a title describing its name, and an icon to indicate the node type.<br>
Relationships between nodes are marked with arrows, starts from the connected node and ends in the target node.<br>
The topology view shows only the application nodes and not the network nodes. If a node has network dependency, it will be displayed as a bullet icon in the node title.<br>
The number of node instances is marked in a bullet beside the node type icon.<br>
Pressing a node title will open a side panel with details of the selected node.<br>
