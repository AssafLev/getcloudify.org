# Overview

For Cloudify to be able to deploy your application it parses the uploaded blueprint YAML (the logical representation) and manifests a structure we call a Deployment. A deployment is a "Technical" drilled down representation of your application. For instance, if a blueprint describes a Server node with multiple instances, the deployment will be comprised of only the instances themselves provided with their unique identifiers. A deployment's structure is not exposed to the user.


# Creating a Deployment

## CLI

To create a deployment using Cloudify's CLI execute:

{%highlight bash%}
cfy deployments create -b <BLUEPRINT_NAME> -d <DEPLOYMENT_NAME> --inputs </path/to/your/inputs.yamlâ€‹>
{%endhighlight%}


## UI

This guide will explain how to create new [deployment]({{page.terminology_deployment}}) using the user interface.<br/>

To Create a new [deployment]({{page.terminology_deployment}}), go to the blueprints screen, choose a blueprint (see [Upload Blueprint]({{page.blueprint_upload}})) and click on the button `Create Deployment`:<br/>

A create deployment dialog will open.<br/>

Next, please fill out the deployment name and insert raw input params (optional), then click on `create` button:<br/>

After creating the deployment, you will be directed to the deployment's page to follow the initialization stage:<br/>

Once the initialization is complete, you will be able to start using the deployment and execute [workflows]({{page.terminology_workflow}}):<br/>
