# Overview

For Cloudify to be able to deploy your application it parses the uploaded blueprint YAML (the logical representation) and manifests a structure we call a Deployment. A deployment is a "Technical" drilled down representation of your application. For instance, if a blueprint describes a Server node with multiple instances, the deployment will be comprised of only the instances themselves provided with their unique identifiers.


# Creating a Deployment via the CLI

To create a deployment using Cloudify's CLI execute:

{%highlight bash%}
cfy deployments create -b <BLUEPRINT_NAME> -d <DEPLOYMENT_NAME> --inputs </path/to/your/inputs.yamlâ€‹>
{%endhighlight%}


# Creating a Deployment via the Web UI

This guide will explain how to create new [deployment]({{page.terminology_deployment}}) using the user interface.<br/>

To Create a new [deployment]({{page.terminology_deployment}}), go to the blueprints screen, choose a blueprint (see [Upload Blueprint]({{page.blueprint_upload}})) and click on the button `Create Deployment`:<br/>
![Create deployment button](/guide/images/ui/ui-create-deployment.jpg)

A create deployment dialog will open.<br/>

Next, please fill out the deployment name and insert raw input params (optional), then click on `create` button:<br/>

After creating the deployment, you will be directed to the deployment's page to follow the initialization stage:<br/>

Once the initialization is complete, you will be able to start using the deployment and execute [workflows]({{page.terminology_workflow}}):<br/>

# Create the Deployment

We'll now create the deploying for our blueprint.

To do so, type the following command:

{%highlight bash%}

cfy deployments create -b nodecellar -d nodecellar --inputs inputs.yaml

{%endhighlight%}

We've now created a deployment named `nodecellar` based on a blueprint with the same name.

This deployment is not yet materialized, since we haven't issued an installation command.

If you click the "Deployments" icon in the left sidebar in the web UI, you will see that all nodes are labeled with 0/1, which
ans they're pending creation.
