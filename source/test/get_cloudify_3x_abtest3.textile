						Ever notice how sometimes you come across somebody you shouldn't have f**ked with? well, i'm that guy. 
						when a naked man's chasing a woman through an alley with a butcher knife and a hard-on, i figure he's not out collecting for the red cross. what you have to ask yourself is, do i feel lucky. well do ya' punk? 
						you see, in this world there's two kinds of people, my friend: those with loaded guns and those who dig. you dig. 
						are you feeling lucky punk you want a guarantee, buy a toaster. don't p!ss down my back and tell me it's raining. 
						dyin' ain't much of a livin', boy. well, do you have anything to say for yourself? here. put that in your report!" and "i may have found a way out of here. man's gotta know his limitations.
						 this is my gun, clyde!
