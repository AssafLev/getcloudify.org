<!-- Thumb Image and Description -->
<img src="https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/501611514_295x166.webp" alt="I'm far from being an HR specialist; Even so, I've interviewed approximately 30 people for an Ops Lead role and couldn't find even one to stand up to my requirements. I've also heard of many (many) bad questions and wrong decisions made by interviewers because of which they didn't get the right person for the job. I would like to present the problem of why, in my opinion, it is hard to find that right person; why interviewers should stop looking for "DevOps" and start looking for "Good, Technical People" and why, after all, 30 people didn't suffice.">

<img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/WFX_vfRimIA/0.jpg" alt="The massive computing and storage resources that are needed to support big data applications make cloud environments an ideal fit. Now more than ever, there is a growing number of choices of cloud infrastructure providers, from Amazon AWS, OpenStack offered by the likes of HP, Rackspace and soon even Dell, VMware vCloud as well as private cloud offerings based on OpenStack, CloudStack, vCloud, and more. There is also a new class of bare-metal clouds from SoftLayer and PistonCloud that provide high performance resources designed for I/O and CPU intensive applications that don't run as well on a virtualized resources. The recent announcements by Google & Microsoft about their new infrastructure as a service offerings, add additional significant players to this growing marketplace.
Given the diverse options, and the dynamic environments involved, it becomes ever more important to maintain the flexibility to choose the right cloud for the job.
In this session, you'll learn how to deploy and manage a Cassandra cluster on any Cloud, as well as manage the rest of your big data application stack using a new open source framework called "Cloudify." (Visit cloudifysource.org)">

<img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/dD8XbBPb_Vg/0.jpg" alt="Marrying DevOps and PaaS: Tools like Chef and Puppet have gained a lot of momentum in the last year or so. But the concept of DevOps and recipes can go well beyond setup, to actually accelerate the entire lifecycle of your applications, from setup, to monitoring, through maintaining high availability, and auto-scaling when required. In this session we'll see how to use Chef and Cloudify together to create a complete and powerful application level orchestration on any cloud, using Cloudify and Chef. More specifically, we'll learn how to automatically provision nodes on the cloud of your choice, based the requirements of your application, auto install Chef client on the provisioned VMs and run the proper Chef roles and recipe on them, and then monitor and auto scale the installed application.">
