<!-- Thumb Image and Description -->
<img src="https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/501611514_295x166.webp" alt="I'm far from being an HR specialist; Even so, I've interviewed approximately 30 people for an Ops Lead role and couldn't find even one to stand up to my requirements. I've also heard of many (many) bad questions and wrong decisions made by interviewers because of which they didn't get the right person for the job. I would like to present the problem of why, in my opinion, it is hard to find that right person; why interviewers should stop looking for "DevOps" and start looking for "Good, Technical People" and why, after all, 30 people didn't suffice.">

In this session he'll discuss what TOSCA is all about, why it makes sense in the context of CloudStack, and how we can take it farther up the stack to handle complete applications, both during and after deployment, on top of CloudStack.">

<img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/dD8XbBPb_Vg/0.jpg" alt="Marrying DevOps and PaaS: Tools like Chef and Puppet have gained a lot of momentum in the last year or so. But the concept of DevOps and recipes can go well beyond setup, to actually accelerate the entire lifecycle of your applications, from setup, to monitoring, through maintaining high availability, and auto-scaling when required. In this session we'll see how to use Chef and Cloudify together to create a complete and powerful application level orchestration on any cloud, using Cloudify and Chef. More specifically, we'll learn how to automatically provision nodes on the cloud of your choice, based the requirements of your application, auto install Chef client on the provisioned VMs and run the proper Chef roles and recipe on them, and then monitor and auto scale the installed application.">
