						<h1><strong>NFV Orchestration</strong> with TOSCA</h1>
						<p>NFV, (network function virtualization, AKA VNFs), is the growing need by Telcos and enterprises to deploy, manage and scale their network functions and services on standardized hardware.  Cloudify,  provides the full end-to-end lifecycle of NFV orchestration – from installation and deployment through monitoring of KPIs, with automatic action taking such as auto-healing and auto-scaling based on metrics -- i.e. Day 0 through Day 2 support -- all through a simple TOSCA-based YAML blueprint.  This significantly simplifies the complexities involved with exposing networking elements to the user by abstracting the networking piece of our deployment into an application blueprint, all while enabling the hardening of security to match the application topology exactly.</p>

						<p>Many big Telcos have chosen and are evaluating Cloudify in large part due to it being open source, as well as modular in nature, enabling pluggability with existing and new toolsets and environments.  On top of this, Cloudify provides many plugins to interface with peripheral network databases, such as DNS and LDAP, and has already demonstrated its capabilities to orchestrate large subsystems like IMS, internet activation and provisioning per tenant out of the box .  With the ability to have one manager that supports multiple clouds (from VMware to OpenStack) as well as multiple data centers and availability zones, Cloudify, is very attractive to mid to large Telcos, ISPs, and enterprises with a hybrid cloud model.  </p>

						<p>VMware is just one such company that has selected Cloudify as their orchestration platform of choice to launch applications and VNFs on vCloud Air.

					<h2><strong>Transition Easily to the Cloud of Your Choice with our VMware Plugin</strong></h2>
					<p> When it comes to VMware adoption there are mainly three cloud platforms:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>vCenter and vSphere that provide virtualization services for traditional data centers, and generally the most widely adopted VMware platform.</li>
					<li>vCloud and vCloud Air provide cloud-oriented services on top of vSphere. vCloud Air is the VMware public cloud offering based on the vCloud API.</li>
					<li>VMware Integrated OpenStack provides an OpenStack compatible interface on top of vSphere/vCenter.</li>
					</ul>


					<p>That's why it was an important target for Cloudify to be able to expand its already broad support of cross-cloud orchestration, to support VMware's virtualization and cloud offerings. Cloudify provides TOSCA-based orchestration that support all three platforms as outlined in the diagram below.</p>

					<br/>
					<!-- <p>VMware vCloud Air adds a unique solution for the integration of public cloud resources into a private cloud environment as a native extension of the existing data center.</p> -->
					<p>The support for all three VMware environments provides VMware users with a common management and automation framework. This makes it possible to easily build a VMware hybrid cloud with vCloudAir as the public cloud, and vSphere/vCenter or even OpenStack as private cloud.</p>

					<p>Cloudify supports a range of application packaging and configuration management starting from a simple script based packages to Chef, Puppet, SaltStack and now also Docker.  This allows VMware users to leverage their existing investment in any of those frameworks and include Cloudify as a complementary platform to their existing environment.</p>



					<p>TOSCA (Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications) provides an industry standard format for describing an application blueprint. Using the TOSCA standard as its templating language, Cloudify makes irrelevant any changes at the lower level infrastructure and, thus is able to easily migrate workloads across environments.</p>

					<h3><b>Key Solution Benefits</b></h3>

					<ul>
					  <li>TOSCA-based orchestration for VMware hybrid deployments </li>

					  <li>Topology-driven management and monitoring of an application throughout its lifecycle </li>

					  <li>Integration with any tool chain </li>
					</ul>

					<p><b></b></p>

					<h3><b>Cloudify’s Secret Sauce</b></h3>

					<p>Cloudify is the only pure-play orchestration framework uniquely positioned to fit into heterogeneous enterprise and Telco environments, and also includes:</p>

					<ul>
					  <li>Support for any application stack, with native OpenStack support </li>

					  <li>Support for containerized (via Docker) and non-containerized workloads </li>

					  <li>Deployment modeling using standard TOSCA blueprints </li>

					  <li>Support for comprehensive monitoring </li>

					  <li>Built in auto-healing and auto-scaling policies for deployed applications </li>

					  <li>Support for DevOps related tool chains. </li>

					<h3><b>Use Case: NFV in a Week with Open Source Tooling</b></h3>

					<p>A major Telco was looking to  expand its offering to provide on-demand internet connectivity for small to medium-sized offices.  This would include a web portal that provides a simple experience to choose an internet provider, as well as infrastructure considerations -- speed, security, and VPN - and any other additional services required, instantaneously, and get connected.  Much like on-demand cloud resources.</p>
					<p>To be able to truly be able to offer such an added value service, this entire process would need to be automated, be able to support the connection to many devices that are software driven, with consistent management and orchestration.</p>
					<p>To do so, they realized they would need an NFV architecture, coupled with a standard-driven orchestration engine to provide the backbone for this virtualized networking environment. </p>

					<p>Through the Cloudify orchestrator the Telco was able to define a TOSCA blueprint that brings up all of the pieces in the architecture, and places them in the right service chain.</p>

			<h2><b>How it Works</b></h2>
			<img style="float: left; display: inline" src="/img/autoscale2.png" width="450" align="left" /> 
			<p><b>Step 1: Model Your Application</b></p>

			<p>Standards-based blueprint, provision VMs, configure network</p>

			<p><b>Step 2: Install your Application</b></p>

			<p>Integrate with Chef, Puppet, Docker, SaltStack</p>

			<p><b>Step 3: Manage Your Application</b></p>

			<p>Add monitoring, logging, alerts, execute workflow for updates, patches, etc.</p>

			<p><b>Step 4: Add Auto-Healing, Auto-Scaling</b><b></b></p>

			<p>Continuously detect and correct failure, add more capacity </p>
