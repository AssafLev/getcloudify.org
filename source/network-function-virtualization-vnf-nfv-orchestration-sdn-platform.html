						<h1><strong>NFV Orchestration</strong> with TOSCA</h1>
						<p>NFV, (network function virtualization, AKA VNFs), is the growing need by Telcos and enterprises to deploy, manage and scale their network functions and services on standardized hardware.  Cloudify,  provides the full end-to-end lifecycle of NFV orchestration – from installation and deployment through monitoring of KPIs, with automatic action taking such as auto-healing and auto-scaling based on metrics -- i.e. Day 0 through Day 2 support -- all through a simple TOSCA-based YAML blueprint.  This significantly simplifies the complexities involved with exposing networking elements to the user by abstracting the networking piece of our deployment into an application blueprint, all while enabling the hardening of security to match the application topology exactly.</p>

						<p>Many big Telcos have chosen and are evaluating Cloudify in large part due to it being open source, as well as modular in nature, enabling pluggability with existing and new toolsets and environments.  On top of this, Cloudify provides many plugins to interface with peripheral network databases, such as DNS and LDAP, and has already demonstrated its capabilities to orchestrate large subsystems like IMS, internet activation and provisioning per tenant out of the box .  With the ability to have one manager that supports multiple clouds (from VMware to OpenStack) as well as multiple data centers and availability zones, Cloudify, is very attractive to mid to large Telcos, ISPs, and enterprises with a hybrid cloud model.  </p>

						<p>VMware is just one such company that has selected Cloudify as their orchestration platform of choice to launch applications and VNFs on vCloud Air.

					<h2><strong>Transition Easily to the Cloud of Your Choice with our VMware Plugin</strong></h2>
					<p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

					<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

					<h3><b>Use Case: NFV in a Week with Open Source Tooling</b></h3>

					<p>A major Telco was looking to  expand its offering to provide on-demand internet connectivity for small to medium-sized offices.  This would include a web portal that provides a simple experience to choose an internet provider, as well as infrastructure considerations -- speed, security, and VPN - and any other additional services required, instantaneously, and get connected.  Much like on-demand cloud resources.</p>
					<p>To be able to truly be able to offer such an added value service, this entire process would need to be automated, be able to support the connection to many devices that are software driven, with consistent management and orchestration.</p>
					<p>To do so, they realized they would need an NFV architecture, coupled with a standard-driven orchestration engine to provide the backbone for this virtualized networking environment. </p>

					<p>Through the Cloudify orchestrator the Telco was able to define a TOSCA blueprint that brings up all of the pieces in the architecture, and places them in the right service chain.</p>

			<h2><b>How it Works</b></h2>
			<img style="float: left; display: inline" src="/img/autoscale2.png" width="450" align="left" /> 
			<p><b>Step 1: Model Your Application</b></p>

			<p>Standards-based blueprint, provision VMs, configure network</p>

			<p><b>Step 2: Install your Application</b></p>

			<p>Integrate with Chef, Puppet, Docker, SaltStack</p>

			<p><b>Step 3: Manage Your Application</b></p>

			<p>Add monitoring, logging, alerts, execute workflow for updates, patches, etc.</p>

			<p><b>Step 4: Add Auto-Healing, Auto-Scaling</b><b></b></p>

			<p>Continuously detect and correct failure, add more capacity </p>
