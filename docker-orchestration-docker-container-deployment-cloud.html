						<h1><strong>Introducing Docker Orchestration for your Docker Container with the Cloudify 3.0 Plugin</strong></h1>
						<h2>Built-in Docker Management & Support</h2>
						<p>  Cloudify has a built-in Docker plugin and matching types, which allows users to use Docker containers as part of any topology. This provides a full-blown orchestration and automation method for large-scale Docker-based systems. On top of this, pre-made Docker images for deploying your management environment, provide out-of-the-box cross Linux-distribution support for a more robust experience, easier & faster upgrades for your management environments, along with a faster bootstrap process. </p>

					<h1><strong>Intelligent Docker Orchestration</strong> - Gluing All the Pieces Together</h1>
					<p>Docker containers were created to help enable the fast, and reliable deployment of application components or tiers, by creating a container that holds a self-contained ready to deploy parts of applications, with the middleware and the app business logic needed to run them successfully.  For example, a Spring application within a Tomcat container.  By design, Docker is purposely an isolated self-contained part of the application, typically one tier or even one node in a tier.</p>
					<p>However, an application is typically multi-tier in its architecture and that means you have tiers with dependencies between them, where the nature of the dependencies can be anything from network connections and remote API invocations, to exchange of messages between application tiers.  And hence an app is a set of different containers with specific configurations.  This is why you need a way to glue the pieces of your app together.</p>
					<p>This is where Cloudify comes in - with Cloudify's Docker orchestration, we will take care of the timing of container creation by order of dependency, as well as all of the necessary configurations to allow the containers to communicate and pass the required runtime properties to one another.</p>

								<p><strong><font color="#00B4DA" style="font-size:16px;"> Docker based Management Environment</font></strong></p>
								<p>Premade Docker images will replace the current package-based method for deploying a management environment.</p>
								<p>This will provide:</p>
								<ul>
								<li>An out-of-the-box cross distribution support while also bridging dependency tree gaps between different user provided images.</li>
								<li>A singleton approach – using only one distribution for the Docker images – will provide a more robust experience.</li>
								<li>Easier, faster upgrades for your management environments.</li>
								<li>A faster bootstrap process.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>This will nicely mesh with the Manager Blueprint approach and the Docker and Fabric plugins for a seamless management environment provisioning experience.</p>

								<p>Cloudify 3.0 has built-in plug-ins for Apache CloudStack and VMware vSphere, (with vCloud and SoftLayer coming soon). It also comes with an open plug-in architecture to support other clouds such as Amazon AWS, GCE, CloudStack as well as Linux containers such as Docker (plug-ins that will all be released in the coming few weeks). With Cloudify 3.0, it is now possible to span the same application across multiple cloud environments without creating a new Cloudify setup per environment. This is useful for users who are transitioning from their existing environment into a cloud environment, and also for allowing bursting and simple hybrid cloud deployments between OpenStack, VMware, Amazon and other clouds.</p>
