						<h1><strong>Introducing Docker Orchestration for your Docker Container with the Cloudify 3.0 Plugin</strong></h1>
						<h2>Built-in Docker Management & Support</h2>
						<p>  Cloudify has a built-in Docker plugin and matching types, which allows users to use Docker containers as part of any topology. This provides a full-blown orchestration and automation method for large-scale Docker-based systems. On top of this, pre-made Docker images for deploying your management environment, provide out-of-the-box cross Linux-distribution support for a more robust experience, easier & faster upgrades for your management environments, along with a faster bootstrap process. </p>

					<h1><strong>Intelligent Docker Orchestration</strong> - Gluing All the Pieces Together</h1>
					<p>Docker containers were created to help enable the fast, and reliable deployment of application components or tiers, by creating a container that holds a self-contained ready to deploy parts of applications, with the middleware and the app business logic needed to run them successfully.  For example, a Spring application within a Tomcat container.  By design, Docker is purposely an isolated self-contained part of the application, typically one tier or even one node in a tier.</p>
					<p>However, an application is typically multi-tier in its architecture and that means you have tiers with dependencies between them, where the nature of the dependencies can be anything from network connections and remote API invocations, to exchange of messages between application tiers.  And hence an app is a set of different containers with specific configurations.  This is why you need a way to glue the pieces of your app together.</p>
					<p>This is where Cloudify comes in - with Cloudify's Docker orchestration, we will take care of the timing of container creation by order of dependency, as well as all of the necessary configurations to allow the containers to communicate and pass the required runtime properties to one another.</p>

								<p><strong><font color="#00B4DA" style="font-size:16px;"> Docker-based Management Environment</font></strong></p>
								<p>Premade Docker images will replace the current package-based method for deploying a management environment.</p>
								<p>This will provide:</p>
								<ul>
								<li>An out-of-the-box cross distribution support while also bridging dependency tree gaps between different user provided images.</li>
								<li>A singleton approach – using only one distribution for the Docker images – will provide a more robust experience.</li>
								<li>Easier, faster upgrades for your management environments.</li>
								<li>A faster bootstrap process.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>This will nicely mesh with the Manager Blueprint approach and the Docker and Fabric plugins for a seamless management environment provisioning experience.</p>

								<p><strong><font color="#00B4DA" style="font-size:16px;">Bake Your Docker Images</font></strong></p>
								<p>Docker is changing the face of configuration management through its ability to reliably capture changes made to all levels: OS, file system - and create a portable image that can then be deployed on any Docker-compliant system, which includes most Linux flavors.  This enables you to "bake" golden Docker images that are much more lightweight, and easy to create as well as automate the creation of.
								With its built-in change management mechanism, every change you make to the image is captured.  This makes it possible to easily roll back changes, and update the most recent changes (i.e. just the delta to your build), instead of having to build the entire image from scratch every time.  It functions very similar to git, where every commit has a unique identifier and you can actually revert last commits individually, so you don’t have to revert all changes.</p>
