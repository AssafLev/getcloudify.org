Cloudify can be installed by using different methods.

Since it is based on a set of premade packages, it can be deployed using shell scripts, configuration management tools, cloud specific orchestration tools (CloudFormation, Heat, etc..) or Cloudify's CLI tool which provides a smooth experience for getting a fully working, cli manageable Cloudify Management server.
