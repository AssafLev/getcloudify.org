						<h1><strong>TOSCA Orchestration</strong>  for VMware</h1>
						<p>VMWare has been a leader of the enterprise virtualization space for many years and is by far the most popular industry solution to date.  On top of their virtualization solutions, VMware has also entered the cloud arena with private and public cloud offerings - from vCloud through vCloudAir.</p>
						<p>To that end, we have built our TOSCA orchestration for VMware that allows you to transition and migrate workloads easily between your VMware infrastructure and any cloud - and back again, all with a simple blueprint.</p>

					<h2>Transition Easily to the Cloud of Your Choice with our VMware Plugin</h2>
					<p> When it comes to VMware adoption there are mainly three cloud platforms:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>vCenter and vSphere that provide virtualization services for traditional data centers, and generally the most widely adopted VMware platform.</li>
					<li>vCloud and vCloudAir provide cloud-oriented services on top of vSphere. vCloudAir is the VMware public cloud offering based on the vCloud API.</li>
					<li>VMware â€“ OpenStack provides an OpenStack compatible interface on top of vSphere/vCenter.</li>
					</ul>


					<p>That's why it was an important target for Cloudify to be able to expand its already broad support of cross-cloud orchestration, to support VMware's virtualization and cloud offerings. Cloudify provides TOSCA-based orchestration that support all three platforms as outlined in the diagram below.</p>

					<br/>

					<p>With this integration VMware users can automate the deployment, management and monitoring of both simple web applications through large-scale applications such as microservices, big data applications, stream processing as well as legacy applications.</p>
					<p>Cloudify supports a range of application packaging and configuration management starting from a simple script based packages to Chef, Puppet, SaltStack and now also Docker.  This allows VMware users to leverage their existing investment in any of those frameworks and include Cloudify as a complementary platform to their existing environment.</p>
					<p>The support for all three VMware environments provides VMware users with a common management and automation framework. This makes it possible to easily build a VMware hybrid cloud with vCloudAir as the public cloud, and vSphere/vCenter or even OpenStack as private cloud.</p>
